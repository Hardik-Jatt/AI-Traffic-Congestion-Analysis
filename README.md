# AI-Powered Traffic Congestion Analysis

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Traffic Congestion Analysis** project leverages historical traffic data, machine learning, and reports from sources like TOMTOM and INRIX to analyze congestion patterns and provide insights.

## Features
- **Historical Traffic Data Collection:** Uses APIs such as TOMTOM and traffic reports from INRIX.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and structures historical data for analysis.
- **Traffic Pattern Analysis:** Uses historical trends to understand congestion behavior.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Predicts congestion levels based on past data and is deployed on AWS Lambda.
- **Data Visualization:** Heatmaps and historical trends presented in a Flask-based dashboard.
- **Insightful Travel Recommendations:** Provides suggestions based on congestion trends.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Cloud Computing:** Amazon EC2
- **Machine Learning Deployment:** AWS Lambda
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask
- **Traffic Data Sources:** TOMTOM API, INRIX Reports

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- AWS EC2

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** → Fetch historical traffic data from APIs and reports.
2. **Preprocessing** → Clean, transform, and structure data for analysis.
3. **Traffic Analysis** → Analyze congestion trends and historical patterns.
4. **Model Training & Deployment** → Train ML model & deploy on AWS Lambda.
5. **Visualization & Insights** → Generate dashboards, heatmaps, and trend analysis.
6. **Travel Recommendations** → Provide insights based on past congestion patterns.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate more traffic data sources.
- Improve predictive accuracy with deep learning models.
- Deploy dashboard on a cloud platform.
