# AI-Powered Traffic Congestion Analysis

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Traffic Congestion Analysis** project leverages real-time traffic data, big data processing, and machine learning to predict congestion levels and provide alternative travel suggestions using Generative AI.

## Features
- **Real-time Traffic Data Collection:** Uses APIs or simulated datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Removes noise and structures data for analysis.
- **Real-time Data Processing:** Utilizes Apache Spark & Kafka for large-scale data streaming.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Predicts congestion levels and is deployed on AWS Lambda.
- **Data Visualization:** Heatmaps and historical trends presented in a dashboard.
- **Generative AI for Route Suggestions:** Provides alternative routes and travel recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Big Data Processing:** Apache Spark, Apache Kafka
- **Machine Learning Deployment:** AWS Lambda
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Dash/Streamlit
- **Generative AI:** OpenAI GPT, LLMs

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- AWS EC2


## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection** → Fetch real-time traffic data.
2. **Preprocessing** → Clean, transform, and structure data.
3. **Real-time Processing** → Apache Spark & Kafka handle large-scale streaming.
4. **Model Training & Deployment** → Train ML model & deploy on AWS Lambda.
5. **Visualization & Insights** → Generate dashboards, heatmaps, and trends.
6. **Generative AI Suggestions** → Provide alternative routes for congestion avoidance.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate more traffic data sources.
- Improve predictive accuracy with deep learning models.
- Deploy dashboard on a cloud platform.
